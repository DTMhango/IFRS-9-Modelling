# IFRS-9-Modelling

The purpose of this project is to develop a fully automated IFRS 9 impairment model approach that computes expected credit losses. 
The FLI module fethches macroeconomic data from the IMF and incorporates the data into the probability of default computation in order to obtain macro-adjusted probabilities of default.
